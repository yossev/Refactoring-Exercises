class Billing {
    private String creditCard;
    private String bankAccount;
}

class Preferences {
    private boolean darkMode;
    private String language;
}

// GodUser as it is and init Preferences and Billing to it( You need to make
// constructors ofc)

// this solution uses 'Extract class' method
